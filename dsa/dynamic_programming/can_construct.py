"""
Write a function canConstruct(target, word_bank)
that accepts a target string and an array of strings.

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not 
the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of
the wordbank array.

You may reuse elements of wordbank as many times as needed.

    Operation 1: Recursion Factor inside For Loop
    Run Time complexity: O(n^m)
    You have a n branches on a tree with height of m. 
    So we multiply n decisions by itself m times to get 
    the number of decisions being made. Hence, n^m run time.

    Operation 2: str.replace()
    Run Time complexity: O(m)
    Worst case you have to replace all of the characters in 
    the string, which has time complexity of the size of the
    string.
